## Saving for the future should too

In the UK there are now 4.7 million of us who are self-employed and that number keeps on growing.

Multiple jobs at once, side hustles, and full-time freelancing mean more and more of us aren’t being properly served by existing models.

We have been left adrift, relying on outdated systems to cobble together a confusing array of pots for coverage.

We know you deserve better.

## We are redesigning pensions to work for you

At Jamjar, we believe you shouldn’t need to be a financial genius to understand what you need and how to get it.

We’re building a pension savings platform with you at the center. A way to set and achieve your goals, save what you can, when you can and combine existing pots – all in one place. 

We believe the freedom to work how you want should be met with the power to tame volatility. We want to offer stable footing for everyone, regardless of circumstance.

## Help us build a better future

We are in the early stages of development for our savings product. If you'd like to contribute, please take a few minutes to register your interest and fill in our questionnaire.
